        <p class="card-text">Dear Students,<br><br>
          As it is known, in accordance with the decision taken at the meeting of the Council of Higher Education on 9.8.2012, I have been serving as the Dean of Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine since the said date. Since the date I took office, we, as a team, have worked to increase the national and international recognition of our faculty, to create a faculty environment that is "Scientific and Humane", sensitive to social problems, constructive and friendly with its students, to improve medical education and to find solutions to the problems of students, research assistants, and faculty members.
          I would like to say that I have benefited greatly from the feedback and contributions of my students during my deanship and that I attach great importance to your support.
          As a result of our evaluations taking into account the change in management at our university, although we have no reservations about working with the new management, I am leaving my duty as dean as of January 1, 2015, with the belief that a responsible administrator has the right to carry out his own plans and programs with the people he chooses.
          I would like to thank all my colleagues, especially my assistant deans with whom I am very happy to work.
          I would like to state that I will be near you from now on and the door of my room in the Department of Pediatrics (2nd floor) is always open to you.
          I wish you a happy new year and love.<br><br>
          Good luck, our dear students.<br><br>
          December 25, 2014<br>
          Prof. Dr. Şükrü Hatun<br>
          Dean<br>
